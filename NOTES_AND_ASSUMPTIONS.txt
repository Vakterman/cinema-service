1. For first easiest tasks I picked 2 datasets:
   - title.basics.tsv.gz (unpack it and put to dataset directory with name title.basics.tsv)
   - title.ratings.tsv.gz (unpack it and put to dataset directory title.ratings.tsv)
   I decided it would be enough to get basic information  and provide minimum which is necessary for getting title info.

2. For this purposes I designed my own schema version because text indexes are not best choice as primary key. Data preprocessing was implemented in Python. 

Pre-processing python scripts  can be launched in next way:
$ python batch_processing.py batch_processing.conf

This command drops and re-creates test database (name can be set in configuration file ) with title_info schema

3. I have implemented  full-text search for primary title but not for original title (for original title I created
simple index)

4. API examples you can see in swagger specification
5. For simplicity I did not use any sophisticated frameworks in order to retrieve data from db. Just my own implementation.
